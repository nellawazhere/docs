# Broadstripes LLC Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: November 1, 2018; Last Updated: December 4, 2014**

Thanks for using Broadstripes. Our goal is to put powerful technology in the hands of people making positive change in the labor and social sector, and we take the respect and protection of your privacy and security very seriously.

Broadstripes LLC ("Broadstripes" or "we") has created this privacy policy (the "Policy") to explain our privacy practices so you will understand when and how information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our Broadstripes CRM service (the "Service") and Web site located at https://help.broadstripes.com (the "Site"). By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.

Because of changes in technology and the growth and development of our business, Broadstripes may need to modify this Policy from time to time. Changes to this Policy are discussed at the end of this document.

### Section 1. Types of Information We Collect About You

Broadstripes collects, uses and discloses two types of information: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. "Personal Information" is information that is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a user's name, initials or nickname, e-mail address, and user-chosen ID and password. "Non-Personal Information" is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity.

### Section 2. Children

The Site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

### Section 3. Gathering, Use, and Disclosure of Non-Personal Information

**3.1 Gathering Non-Personal Information**

**3.1.1 Web Browsers**

Like most Site operators, Broadstripes gathers from users of the Site Non-Personal Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the user's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the Web pages the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Site.

**3.1.2 Cookies**

A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a Site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. Broadstripes uses cookies to track a user's use of the Site during each Site session, both to help Broadstripes improve users' experiences and to help Broadstripes understand how the Site is being used. YOU CAN MODIFY THE SETTING TO REJECT COOKIES OR TO PROMPT YOU BEFORE ACCEPTING A COOKIE FROM THE SITES YOU VISIT BY EDITING YOUR BROWSER OPTIONS. IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO ACCEPT OUR COOKIES, HOWEVER, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE SERVICE.

**3.1.3 Google Web Analytics Service**

Broadstripes also uses cookies as part of the Google Web Analytics service that Broadstripes uses on the Site. Broadstripes may collect, use and disclose Non-Personal Information by means of the cookies used in connection with Google Web Analytics, and such use is subject to this Policy. In addition, Google may collect Non-Personal Information about you by means of the Google Web Analytics service. Google's use of this Non-Personal Information is subject to the Google Privacy Policy (currently located at http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/). For further information about third parties' collection of Non-Personal Information and Personal Information by means of the Site, please see Section 5 below.

**3.1.4 Internal Web Analytics Service**

Broadstripes also uses cookies as part of an internal Web Analytics system that we created for the Site. Broadstripes may collect and use Non-Personal Information by means of the cookies used in connection with the Service, and such use is subject to this Policy. We will only disclose such information to administrators affiliated with your Organization.

**3.1.5 Web Beacons**

A "Web Beacon" is an object that is embedded in a web page or email message. It is usually invisible to users but allows Site operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or email message. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page or message view, and a description of the page or message on which the Web Beacon resides.

You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. Third parties are not permitted to use Web Beacons on the Site.

**3.2 Use of Non-Personal Information**

Broadstripes analyzes Non-Personal Information gathered from Site users to help Broadstripes better understand how the Site is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Broadstripes is able to better design the Site to improve users' experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. Broadstripes does not link information gathered using cookies and Web Beacons to Personal Information.

**3.3 Disclosure of Non-Personal Information**

We use cookie technology to: (i) collect information so that we can improve our Site by seeing which areas and features are most popular; (ii) personalize the Site and improve the Site experience; and (iii) allow you to visit the Site without re-entering your member ID and/or password during a continuous session.

Broadstripes discloses Personal Information if: (1) required to do so by law, or in response to a subpoena or court order; (2) Broadstripes believes at its sole discretion that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, to protect the property or other rights of Broadstripes, other users, third parties or the public at large; and (3) Broadstripes believes that you have abused the service by using it to attack other systems or to gain unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming or otherwise to violate applicable laws.
