## Intro
Broadstripes search builder allows you to search for very specific info including who has attended a rally in the last month or signed a card in the past week. In Broadstripes, that type of information is recorded as **events** and **event steps**. Keep in mind that **events** are created and customized by users and admins, so each project will have its own unique events. (Learn more in the [creating events](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/customize/create-events-to-track-goals/) article.)
In this article, we're going to show you how to do a search based on an event we've created called "**Card**" to find all the people who have signed a card in the past week.
## Build a search to capture events in time
In another article, we [built a search to look at people who had not yet signed cards](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/customize/search-by-event-step/). For this article, we're going to assume it's a week later, and we want to see how many new cards have been signed since we ran that previous search. Here's how:
1. Start a new search by clicking the **Search builder button** to the right of the search box at the top of the page.![](/img/getting-started/SearchSearchBuilderButton2021-e1610573892873.png)
2. A **search building panel** opens below the search box.
3. Since we want to limit our search to workers who have signed a card in the last week, we'll choose the **Card - Signed** event step from the left-hand drop-down menu in the search builder.
4. In the middle drop-down box, select "**was checked on or after**."
6. That's it.
7. Click the **Search** button to run the search. All the workers who have signed cards in the last week will display in the **Search results panel**.
