## Overview

Congratulations! You’re using Broadstripes to organize your labor campaign, and you’re ready to get started. Before you and your organizers can start using Broadstripes, you’ll need to do a few things to get ready.

Getting a new project up and running doesn't have to be complicated. This Getting Started Guide was designed to walk you through each step of this process.

The Getting Started Guide divides your tasks into four basic steps:

1. [Setting up your project’s basic data.](/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/1-setting-up-the-basic-data-in-your-project/)
2. [Preparing your spreadsheet for import.](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/prepare-your-spreadsheet-2/)
3. [Importing your spreadsheet.](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/3-import-your-spreadsheet/)
4. [Inviting your organizers.](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/4-invite-your-organizers/)
5. [Set up your team for successful organizing!](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/5-set-up-team/)

When you’ve completed the tasks in this guide, your Broadstripes project will be customized to meet the needs of your campaign, and your first users will be logged in and ready to start organizing.

If you’re ready to start, let’s move right to [Step 1: Setting up your project’s basic data.](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/1-setting-up-the-basic-data-in-your-project/)
