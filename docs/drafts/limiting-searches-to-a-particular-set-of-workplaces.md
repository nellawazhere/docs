## Intro
One of the most helpful features of Broadstripes is how it can help organizers and other union leaders quickly find people they're looking for.
The **Employer filter** tool makes that even easier for you to do by narrowing your search to a certain group of workplaces or employments.
## Use the employer filter
1. Get started by finding the **Filter drop-down menu** on the left side of the homepage's search bar.
2. Clicking on it will produce the following menu:![](/img/getting-started/db82d09-employer_filter_7.png)
3. At the bottom of the Filter drop-down is a section called **Employer filter**. To filter by employer, search for an employer by name in the text box, then click on the correct suggestion.
