## Overview
Broadstripes' "search builder" helps you find search terms and build complex searches.
As your familiarity with Broadstripes grows, you will likely want to filter your lists with more precision. This will mean searching by multiple criteria at once. For example, you might want to find:
- your leaders at a particular shop
- people whom you've assessed as "ones" but who haven't yet signed a card
- people who attended one of several recent events, but haven't been contacted lately
Broadstripes has a tool to help you do that. It’s called the **search builder**. Here’s a video that explains how it works:
