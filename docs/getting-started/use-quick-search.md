Much of the work you do in Broadstripes will begin with a search. Whether you're trying to pull up the record of one specific person, or all the people at a certain work location, it's simple with **Quick Search**.
1. Click the **Quick Search** link in the toolbar to begin.

6. Instead of simply displaying search results on screen, Broadstripes can also save search results in new files for you to download in **.pdf format** or one of several **spreadsheet formats** (.xls or .csv).![QuickSearchOptionsOutput](/img/getting-started/a283344-QuickSearchOptionsOutput.png)
1. After you've chosen layout and output options, click **Go** to launch the search. Depending on your choices, Broadstripes will show the search results on screen, or export your results to a file you can save.
