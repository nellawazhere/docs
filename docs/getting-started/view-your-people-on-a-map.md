## Get started
With Broadstripes' **Maps** feature, you can easily view any list of people on an interactive map.
1. Start by clicking the **Maps** link on the navigation panel.

2. Clicking this link takes you to Broadstripes' **Maps** page. You'll see the location of every person in your project (who has a good address) pinpointed on the map that appears.
4. For a better look, you can zoom in or out using the **zoom controls** on the left-hand side of the map, or with the **plus** and **minus keys** on your keyboard.![](/img/getting-started/2b7dbc0-MapsViewZoom.png)
5. The **Maps** page also allows you to work with geographic shapes, whether pre-loaded political districts or hand-cut turf. These shapes can be used for political outreach, planning house visits, and other geographically informed analysis of your people.
