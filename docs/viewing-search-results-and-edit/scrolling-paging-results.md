## Overview

Running a search is a great way to narrow down the contact records you're working with – instead of wading through every record in the project, with search results you'll see just the contacts you're interested in.
However, even after running a search, you may still have a large number of contacts included in the results. This article will help you learn to navigate those records.

## The search results page

We'll begin by getting to know the search page. There's a lot of information displayed here. There are also helpful tools for navigating – you just need to know where to look. Below we look at four areas of the search results page.
### 1. Contacts

## Scrolling through results

You can **scroll down** through your search results in a few ways:
> - use your keyboard's **down arrow** or **page down key**.
> - use your **mouse** to scroll down, just as you would with any other web page.
As you scroll down, you will notice that Broadstripes **dynamically loads additional records** as you reach the end of your search results. As more records are loaded (20 at a time), the toolbar will adjust its count (for instance "**Showing 1-20 of 106**" will change to "**Showing 1-40 of 106**") so you can always know the total number of contacts being displayed.
You can keep the header information visible even as you scroll down the search results by clicking the "**magic header"** button. This will "lock" the labels in place at the top of the page.

## Paging through results

If you want to move more quickly through your search results, you can view them a page at a time. First, set the number of results you want to see per page using the "**Show 20 results**" drop-down menu at the top of the page.
Next, use the **page navigation tool** that's located at the top and bottom page of your search results to move from page to page.

You can either **type the page number** you want to view and click **Go** to jump there, or use the navigation arrows. Click the <i class="fa fa-chevron-right fa-fw text-blue-light"></i> **right-facing single chevron** to step forward one page at a time, or click the <i class="fa fa-chevron-double-right fa-fw text-blue-light"></i> **righ-facing double chevron** to go to the very last page of your search results. (Move backward through your results using the <i class="fa fa-chevron-left fa-fw text-blue-light"></i> and <i class="fa fa-chevron-double-left fa-fw text-blue-light"></i> **left-facing chevrons**.)
