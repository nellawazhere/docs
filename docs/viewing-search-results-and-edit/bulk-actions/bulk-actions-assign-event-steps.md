# Action: Check/uncheck event steps
* * *
## Set event steps

When you are checking off an event or an event step for multiple contacts at once, using an action can be a great time-saver. (If you are new to events, check out the [Events](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/customize/create-events-to-track-goals/) overview article for more information.)

For this example, we'll show how to check off signed cards for a group of contacts we visited last week.
1. First, we'll run a search for people on our house visit list. Then, from the **Search Results** page, we'll [select the contacts](/viewing-search-results-and-edit/selecting-deselecting-contacts.md) who have just signed their cards. (If you need help running a search, check out the [Search articles](/search/index.md) article.)
2. With the contacts selected, we'll go to the **Actions** drop-down menu and choose **Check/uncheck event steps**.

3. When prompted to select an event step, we'll choose the **Card > Signed** step and click **Check**.

:::note
If an event step is timeline tracked, you will be prompted to enter a timeline note which will be applied to all contacts in the selected list.

4. Broadstripes will automatically update all of the contact records that we selected to show that their cards are signed. A **notification box** will appear in the upper right to confirm our update.

## Unset (uncheck) an event step

If you want to uncheck (rather than check) an event step for a group of contacts all at once, you can do that from the actions drop-down menu, too. In this example, we have a list of people who were accidentally marked as having signed cards. We need to correct their records to show that they haven't yet signed a card.
1. Again, we'll start by running a search. From the **Search Results** page, we'll [select the contacts](/viewing-search-results-and-edit/selecting-deselecting-contacts.md) we need to correct. (If you need help running a search, check out the[Search articles](/search/index.md)article.)
2. With the contacts selected, we'll go to the **Actions** drop-down menu and choose **Assign Event Steps**.

3. When prompted to select an event step, we'll choose the **Card > Signed** step.

4. Finally, we'll click **Uncheck** to unset (uncheck) the Card > Signed event step.
5. Broadstripes will automatically update all of the contact records that we selected to show that their cards are no longer signed. A **notification box** will appear in the upper right to confirm our update.
