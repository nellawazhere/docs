## Introduction

Nice work! You’ve made it to **Step 3** in the Getting Started Guide. You’re ready to **import your worker list spreadsheet** into Broadstripes.

If you’ve made it to this page, you have already completed the first two steps in the Getting Started Guide:

1. Setting up your project’s basic data.
2. Preparing your spreadsheet for import.

(If you haven’t had a chance to complete these, just go back and finish up, then return here to start your import.)

This section of the Getting Started Guide will take you through **Step 3: Importing your spreadsheet** in two parts:

- [Task 1: Configure the import](#ftoc-heading-2)  
    
- [Task 2: Preview and complete the import](#ftoc-heading-3)

### Task 1: Configure the import

In **Step 2** of the Getting Started Guide, you prepared your worker list spreadsheet for importing. Now we’ll start the import by setting up the data mapping and other configurations. When this is done, we’ll move on to preview and run the import.

Here’s how it works:

### Task 2: Preview and complete the import

In the previous task, you [configured your import](#ftoc-heading-2) in Broadstripes. Now, we’ll look at the import preview and complete the import. Here’s how:

### Next steps

Good job! Your project is set up and you data has been imported. Now it’s time to **invite your team members** to become users of Broadstripes and **set up their homepages to help them get comfortable**!

You can read all about it in the final step of the Getting Started Guide: Invite users and get them organizing.
