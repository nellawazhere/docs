## Background

As of late January 2019, Broadstripes has **new and improved** ways of handling the "contact information" (street addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses) that you import. The improvements were made to reduce the amount of duplicate contact information present in your Broadstripes data.

 This page was created with the goal of helping you understand the (new) logic behind the data import.

## Avoiding duplicate contact info

As mentioned above, the goal of the enhancements to the import logic is to prevent duplication of contact info already present in your Broadstripes database.
