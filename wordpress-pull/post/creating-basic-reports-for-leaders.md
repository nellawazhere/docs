### The **Basic List Report** Method

2. Search for a list of your leaders in the search box. (e.g. leads = any)
3. Select all search results. From the Reports menu, choose the "Basic List (PDF)".![](images/Basic-List-Reports-Menu.png)
4. When the Report Options pop-up window appears, name your spreadsheet and select the "Show Followers or Employees" option.
    - For a list of the people that the organizer leads, select "show people followers"
    - For a list of organizations that the organizer leads, select "show organization followers"
    - The "page breaks" option ensures that leader groups are separated onto distinct pages, facilitating the easy separation and distribution of the printed report to leaders.
