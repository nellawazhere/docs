Here's how:

1. Go to the Settings dropdown menu in the top right and type SMS numbers in the input box.
2. Click the **SMS numbers** option. ![](images/SmsNumbersonSettingsMenu-.png)

4. Enter an area code from which your number will be generated. You should enter an area code that would make sense for your project and potential message recipients. ![](images/smsnumberspageuserareacode.png)
