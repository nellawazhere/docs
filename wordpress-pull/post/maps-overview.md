When you collect address information about a person in Broadstripes, the data can be used for searches or printed on reports. Those records also provide Broadstripes with all the information it needs to drive its **maps feature** – a powerful visual tool that lets you see each of your project's contacts pinpointed by location on a map.

Broadstripes maps allow you to view groups of people filtered in a range of ways:

- according to search criteria
- within a user-defined boundary (called a "**shape**")
- by simply zooming in on any region of the map
- you can even combine these features – for instance, you can zoom in on a certain voting district that you're targeting for legislative change, then run a search for contacts with supportive assessments to see how many supporters you have there.
