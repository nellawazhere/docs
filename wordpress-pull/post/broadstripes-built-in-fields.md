Here's your guide to all of the built-in fields Broadstripes provides for your project.

Broadstripes provides a number of built-in information fields for your project so that you can set it up and add information easily and quickly. This is a complete guide to all of those fields and their intended use.

## People

**Notes**: This is a simple text box for preserving information that does not fit neatly into a format, and also should not be its own custom field. Often notes are one-time events, for example, "8/26, met Jane's neighbor, she said Jane works Friday evenings 3-11." Sometimes they are bits of information specific to the person: "Jane is cousins with Supervisor Maria."

**Nickname**: Here you can put any nicknames that could help you identify or keep track of your workers. This allows you to retain the worker's legal name in your data while allowing people to find them by the name they are commonly called.

**Do Not Text**: This field allows you to quickly "opt-out" a person from a mass text list. This is a check-box that by default is un-checked, meaning every person you upload into Broadstripes is by default opted-in to mass texts, should you choose to send any.

**Title**: A person's preferred title. e.g. Dr., Mrs., Ms., and so on. This is useful for mass mailings.

**First Name**: A person's (legal, official, real) first name.

**Middle Name**: A person's middle name.

**Last Name**: A person's last name. This can be changed in the app in case of marriage/divorce/other name change.

**Suffix**: Any suffixes such as Jr., Senior, II, III can be recorded in-app as well. This is particularly useful when multiple family members work for the same employer.

**Birth Date**: This field records worker birth dates in MM/DD/YYYY format. Birth dates are useful when trying to correctly identify workers with common names or the same name, and also may be used for matching employer records.

**Party ID**: If your project includes voter data, you can use the "Party ID" field to enter registered voters' party affiliation. This is a drop-down menu containing whatever different parties are represented in your data.

**Employment**: The Employment field has several subfields. Department and Classification are the two most commonly used ones, e.g. Department: Housekeeping, Classification: Guest Room Attendant.

Other available subfields include Employee Number, Work location, Hours, Hourly rate, Employee status, Start date, Recent hire date, Date last paid, Seniority date, Bargaining unit member (checkbox), Tip card (checkbox), and full/part time (text box). Depending on the needs of your organization, it may be more useful to create custom fields for this information instead of using the available subfields under Employment.

umm is tip card TIPS certification card?

**Union Member**: This is a simple yes/no checkbox. It can be disabled if your union's membership structure requires a more complicated, custom field.

**Contact Info**: Here is where your person's emails and phone numbers can be stored. Often workers will have work emails and personal emails, and a cell, work, and home number. Broadstripes allows you to classify every entry into the Contact Info field by use type (Personal, Business, Home, or Other) and contact type (Phone, Email, Fax, Pager, IM). You can also set Messaging Permissions for every entry (opt-in or opt-out).

**Address**: You can add as many addresses to this field as you want; just make sure to select the correct Primary address. Only one address can be the Primary address. That address will be the default address displayed in searches.

The Address field has many components, not all of which need to be used for any given entry. The components are: Street Number (e.g.**100** Main St.) Direction prefix (e.g.**North** Main St.) Street Name (e.g. Main St.) Street Type (???) Direction Suffix (e.g. Main St. **South**) Unit (Unit 101) Care of (you probably won't use this field unless you are delivering a package to your worker) PO Box (this is where you would enter a PO Box number) City (e.g. New Haven) State (the two-letter abbreviation, e.g. CT) Zip (first five) e.g. 06511 Zip (plus 4) (e.g. 0611-7045) Organization/Other (if the address is a work address, or any other information about it).

You can also mark addresses as bad. Only do this if you are sure the address is wrong in some way-- if a piece of mail gets returned to you, or the building in question is demolished, or you are otherwise certain that the worker no longer lives there. If you are not certain an address is bad, you can mark it as "Needs review" instead, which will allow you to find it easily at a later date to change or update it.

## Organizations

**Name** The official name of the organization.

**Nickname** If the organization is commonly called something other than its official name, input it here. For instance, Saint Vincent Hospital's nickname could be SVH.

**Notes** This is a simple text box for preserving information that does not fit neatly into a format, and also should not be its own custom field. Often notes are bits of information specific to the organization, for instance, "Floor 12 supervisor is Mary." \[not really sure when you would use notes for organizations tbh?\] **Addresses** Depending on how big your organization is, it may have multiple locations. You can record all affiliated addresses in the Addresses field, although this may not be useful for very large organizations/workplaces. Only one address may be the Primary address: a mailing address or central office is a good choice for a Primary address. Using the Organization/Other field, you can denote what each address is for (e.g. Billing Department, Human Resources, etc).

**Contact Information** **Parent Organization ID**

**Website**: If the employer/organization has a website, it can be stored in this field.
