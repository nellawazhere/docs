## Intro

Broadstripes comes with a number of built-in information fields already included. This means that you can set up your project and add information to it easily and quickly.

Below is a quick guide to Broadstripes' built-in fields and their intended use. (Click [here](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/data-import-admin/data-import-fields) for a full guide to Broadstripes built-in fields and custom fields)

## People

Here's how to store information about workers.

## Physical addresses

Here's a look at all the built-in components of an Address. Just remember that you don't need to use all of them for any given entry.

\[table id=addresscomp /\]

### Multiple addresses and primary addresses

Some people or organizations have multiple locations or addresses. You can add as many addresses to Broadstripes' address field as you want; just make sure to select the correct **Primary address**. Only one address can be the Primary address, and once chosen, that address will be the default address displayed in searches.

For **organizations**, a mailing address or central office is a good choice for a Primary address. For **workers**, the worker's current home address is the recommended choice for a Primary address.

Commonly, **organizations** have multiple locations or addresses. You can record all affiliated addresses in the **Addresses** field, although this may not be useful for very large organizations/workplaces. Using the **Organization/Other** field, you can denote what each address is for (e.g. Billing Department, Human Resources, etc).

### Bad addresses or addresses that need review

You can also mark addresses as "**bad**". Only do this if you are sure the address is wrong in some way-- if a piece of mail gets returned to you, or the building in question is demolished, or you are otherwise certain that the worker no longer lives there.

If you are not certain an address is bad, you can mark it as "**Needs review**" instead, which will allow you to find it easily at a later date to change or update it.
