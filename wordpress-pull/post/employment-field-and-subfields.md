The Employment field has many subfields. It is meant to provide you with a generic set of employee data fields that you are likely to find useful. However, depending on the structure of your workers' employments, you may find this section to be inadequate or not specific enough. In that case, you can use custom fields to record employment data instead.

- **Department**: Department is a built-in subclassification of Employer. For instance, in a factory/warehouse your department might be Distribution.
- **Classification**: Your worker's job title. Examples are Cashier, Attendant, Welder, etc.
- **Employee Number**: If the workplace uses a unique identification number to keep track of workers (Employee ID, Badge Number, etc.), you can enter that number here.
- **Work Location**: You can use this to name the building, floor, office, section etc. where your worker is located.
- **Hours**: The number of hours per week that your person is scheduled to work.
- **Hourly rate**:

**Employee status Start date Recent hire date Date last paid Seniority date Bargaining unit member (checkbox) Full/part time (text box)**
