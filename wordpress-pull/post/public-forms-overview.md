## How can public forms help you organize?

Broadstripes **public forms** give you a way to collect important data like survey responses, contact info or card signatures from anyone with access to the Web – people who aren't Broadstripes users. Forms are fully customizable and can be shared with others by simply sending out a Web link. Anyone who clicks your link will be able to open the form, fill it out, and submit it online. All responses are stored in Broadstripes — your organizers can see them and even be notified by new forms being submitted on their turf!

Here are some examples of how public forms can be used:

- A **digital membership card** that allows workers to legally agree to be represented by the union for collective bargaining. These can be sent to the NLRB for certification, or emailed to HR at the employer to enable payroll dues-deduction to begin.
- A **petition** or **survey** that can capture a worker's (or other campaign supporter's) contact info, signature, and other key data.
- A quick-and-easy **debrief form that an organizer can fill out** from their phone immediately after having an organizing conversation. Using forms this way, Broadstripes can collect information from worker activists and volunteer organizers who may not have direct access to Broadstripes.

### Working with public forms

Since public forms can collect a wide range of information, the interface for creating them has several parts. Therefore, we've split the docs into multiple articles. Together, these articles will guide you through customizing a basic form, collecting different types of data, and viewing the responses you receive. Here's a roadmap to working with public forms:

- [First step: create a new contact type](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/public-forms/first-step/)
- [The "Standard fields" tab](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/public-forms/standard-fields-tab-in-public-form/)
- [The "Timeline" tab](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/public-forms/timeline-tab/)
- [The "Employment" tab](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/public-forms/employment-tab/)
- [The "Form content" tab](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/public-forms/form-content-tab/)
- [The "Email" tab](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/public-forms/email-tab/)
- [The "Other options" tab](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/public-forms/other-options-tab/)
- [Viewing and downloading public forms](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/public-forms/viewing-and-downloading-public-forms/)

To get the full picture of what public forms have to offer, new users should plan to take a look at each article.
