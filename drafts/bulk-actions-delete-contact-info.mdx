# Delete contact info
* * *
## Delete address, phone, and email information from contact records
You can use bulk actions to **permanently delete certain contact information from a contact or group of contacts** from your Broadstripes project. You can delete all types of contact info (addresses, phones and emails) from all groups (personal, business, home and other) or choose a combination of types and groups.
Being able to delete certain contact info can be useful when you make a mistake during your import – for instance importing cell phone numbers as home phones. It might also be used in a case where you want to remove all business phone numbers to avoid accidentally tipping off management to your organizing plans by contacting a person at work.
For this example, we'll show how to permanently delete business phone numbers for a group of workers.
1. We'll start by running a search. From the **Search Results** page, we'll [select the workers](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/working-with-search-results/selecting-deselecting-contacts/) whose business numbers we are deleting. (If you need help running a search, check out the [Create and save a search](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/customize/create-and-save-a-search/) article.)
3. Next, we'll check **Phones** as the **contact type** and select **Business** as the **group** and click **Delete**.![BulkActionsDeleteContactInfoSelectType](/images/getting-started/BulkActionsDeleteContactInfoSelectType-257x300.png)
4. Broadstripes will automatically queue the process of deleting the selected contact info. A **pop-up box** will appear to confirm the deletion is queued. No further action is needed.![BulkActionsDeleteContactConfirm](/images/getting-started/BulkActionsDeleteContactConfirm2020.png)
