# Send a bulk email
This bulk action is a great way to communicate with groups of workers quickly and efficiently. You can compose a single email and send it to multiple workers all at once. You can even include dynamic [merge fields](../communications/using-merge-fields.md) like "First name" so the emails sound more personal. Keep in mind that the workers will need to have a valid email address in Broadstripes which they've "opted in" to receive this kind of message.

If you don't see the **Send email** option in your **Communications** drop down menu, it means you haven't been granted permission to use the feature. Talk to your admin to get set up.
