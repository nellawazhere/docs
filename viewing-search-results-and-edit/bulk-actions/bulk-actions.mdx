# Intro
As you probably know, the search results page lets you see the records that match your search criteria and to view details about those contacts (learn more about creating custom searches in the [Search section](../search/index.md)).
What you might _not_ know is that the search results page contains another powerful feature – the ability to make bulk edits to multiple contact records at one time. You do this by applying a **bulk action** to the contacts in your search results.
Here's a look at all of the actions you can apply:
