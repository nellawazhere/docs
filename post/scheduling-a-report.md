In the app, you can create a report and schedule it to generate later or even on a recurring basis. In addition, you can have these scheduled reports sent directly to your email or other project member's emails. When scheduling a report, you may schedule a one-time report from a static search or you may schedule recurring dynamic reports from a specific search.

This article will guide you through the report scheduling process.
