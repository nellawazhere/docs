Embedding a layout with your saved search means you'll see the same columns of data each time you run the search – without added steps.

1. To start, **run the search** that you want to embed with a new layout. (Learn more about creating searches in the [Search by name](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/search/search-by-name/) or [Search with the search builder](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/search/search-builder-build-an-advanced-search/) articles.)
2. **Add or remove columns** from the search results panel until you've created a layout that meets your needs.
    - Remove columns by clicking the  icon next to the column header.![](images/de4f152-EmbedRemove.png)

- Add columns by going to the **Customization** drop-down menu and selecting "**Modify layout...**".

1. From the list of columns that appears, **single-click** on the name of any column you want to add to your layout, then click **Apply layout**.

1. Next, save the search. Click the **save search** link in the upper right corner of the search panel.![](images/53abc2d-ListPDFSaveSearchlink.png)
2. To embed the layout you just created, check "**Attach current search layout**" before saving. Each time the search is run in the future, Broadstripes will automatically display exactly the same columns of data that are in the current layout.![](images/a6a16da-EmbedSaveSearch.png)
3. Click **Save search**. The search (with its embedded layout) will now appear in the **YOUR SEARCHES** list in the navigational panel on the left-hand side of the page.![](images/6dd2ec0-EmbedSearchNav.png)
