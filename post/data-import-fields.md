## Prepare your spreadsheet for import

In this article, we will explain how to prepare various types of data for import. The table below outlines the different data fields and their required formatting to ensure a smooth and efficient upload. Certain data fields will need specific headings to be identified when setting up data mappings on the data import page in Broadstripes. You can define data mappings manually, but using the appropriate column headers will speed up the process.
