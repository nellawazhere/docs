## Intro

As the admin of your Broadstripes project, you may find that you have a lot of information you want to keep track of – data imports, custom fields, report formats, and user permissions, just to name a few. Thankfully, Broadstripes provides the tools you need to make your job more simple.

One tool you should know about is the **Project settings page** – a single access point for all of your admin tools.

In the upper right corner of any page, click **Settings** > **All settings** to open the **Project settings page**.

When the **Project settings page** opens, you'll see a list of all your project settings in one convenient place. From there, just click a link to view or modify that setting.
