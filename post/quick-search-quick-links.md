## Why add a quick search link?

Since **quick search** is already easy to access and simple to use, you may wonder why you’d need to add it to your quick links tab.

What you might not know is that adding a **quick search quick link** allows you to have all the advantages of quick search’s fast, dynamic search while allowing you to set fixed layout and output preferences – you’ll still be able to run a dynamic search, but Broadstripes will automatically present the results in the right format with no extra steps.

### Example

Imagine that I frequently run the same quick search to create lists of workers from each of the various departments at the shops I organize. After running a department search, I always apply the same “Department list” layout, and always export the list to PDF so I can print it and keep it with me when I’m away from my computer.

If I used the basic quick search to create these printed lists, I’d need to select the layout and output format _each time_ I ran the search. Alternatively, if I used a saved search with a saved layout, I’d have to create a _separate search_ for every single department list I wanted to print.

By creating a **quick search quick link**, I can keep the search flexible but specify the “Department list” layout and the PDF output format. The best part is that I can set it up once, and run the search over and over (choosing any department I want to see) without ever having to specify those output settings again.

Here’s how:

1. Start on the quick links tab and follow the steps outlined in the article [Create quick links](https://web.archive.org/web/20240422121505/https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/customize/create-a-quick-link/) to create your new quick link.
2. Choose **a quick search** as the type of link you want to add and click **Next**.![](images/Quick-link-dialogue-quick-search.png)
3. Choose the **layout**. For this example, I’ll choose **Department List** since this is the layout I want Broadstripes to use each time the search is run.![](images/Quick-Link-choose-layout.png)
4. Click **Next**.
5. Choose the output type and click **Next**. For this example, I’ll choose **PDF**.![](images/Quick-Link-quick-search-choose-format.png)
6. When the output options window opens, give the file a **Title** and **File Name** and specify any other output details that are important to you. Click **Next**.![](images/Quick-Link-configure-report.png)
7. **Name** the quick link. This is the name that will appear on the quick link button on your quick link tab. Click **Done** to save.![](images/Quick-Link-quick-search-name-link2.png)
8. You’ll see the new quick link button on your **Quick Links tab**. Click it to launch a search.![](images/Quick-Link-quick-search-quick-link-added.png)
9. You’ll be prompted to enter **search criteria**, just as you would for a regular quick search. We’ll enter the department we want to see (Housekeeping) and click **Go**.![](https://web.archive.org/web/20240422121505im_/https://i0.wp.com/help.broadstripes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/934bbcf-QLQuickChooseDept.png?resize=558%2C297&ssl=1)
10. After you have chosen the employer or location, you can open the Options panel to change the report's name, layout, and format.![](images/Quick-Link-Options.png)Broadstripes will automatically apply your layout and create the PDF as soon as you click Go. You’ll see a **pop up message** explaining that your PDF report is being created and will download.
11. To view and print your PDF, you have two choices:
    - You can **stay on the current page** and wait for the report to download to your designated download folder.
    - You can **leave the current page** and **check in later** to see if the report is ready. To check for the report later, click the **Reports** link in the navigation panel. That link brings you to the **Requested Reports** page where you can download any requested list at any time.

1. To generate another list for another department, just click the same **quick search button** on your **quick links tab** again. The link will remain there even after you’ve logged out and logged back in again.
2. If you ever need to **delete** a quick link, just click the  **icon** next to its name on the quick link panel.![](images/Quick-Link-quick-search-delete.png)
3. You can also [share a quick link with all the users in a user group](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/share-quick-links-to-a-user-group/).
