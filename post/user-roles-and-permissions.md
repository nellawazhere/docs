## Overview

Before you invite a new organizer or change permissions granted to an existing organizer, you'll want to understand the difference between each of Broadstripes' user roles.

This article gives an in-depth look at Broadstripes' three user roles including exactly what they are allowed to see and do within the project.

- - [Basic users](#ftoc-heading-3)
    - [Project admins](#ftoc-heading-4)

 

Once you've decided what kind of role a user will play, you can visit the [Users and membership guide](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/user-and-membership-overview/) for videos and step-by-step instructions on adding users and assigning or editing user permissions.

## User roles

### Basic user

A **basic user** is a member of a particular project with all the necessary permissions to work with the data in that project. They can:

- Create, edit, and delete contact records for people and organizations (i.e. shops and departments).
- Create, edit, and delete events.
- Create and save searches and layouts (personal or shared).
- Create and save lists (personal or shared)

In addition, on a per-user basis, a project admin can enable a user to download data in XLSX or CSV format. If a user does not have this permission, they will not be able to export lists to spreadsheet form.

### Project admin

A **project admin** has all the capabilities a basic user does. In addition, they can:

- Invite new users, promote existing users to admin, and deactivate existing user memberships from the project.
- Create, update, and delete all project data such as:
    - Custom fields
    - Assessments (aka codes)
    - Leader roles
    - External systems
    - User groups
    - Status reports
    - Calculated columns
    - Contact types
- Import data via spreadsheet.
- Import shape files.

Admins may have other capabilities as well, as determined by the configuration of your project. For example, if a project has SMS (i.e. text) messaging features enabled, admins will have the ability to provision SMS numbers for users.

Note that a user may be an admin in one project and a basic user in another.
