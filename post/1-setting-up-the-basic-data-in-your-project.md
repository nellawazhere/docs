## Introduction

You’re ready to get your Broadstripes project up and running for your organizing team. This section of the [Getting Started Guide](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/getting-started-guide/) will cover the first step of that process: **setting up the basic data in your project**.

In the simplest terms, "setting up the basic data in your project" means getting Broadstripes ready to collect and display the info that's important to you. This page will take you through each step of that process.

We’ve broken down **Step 1: Setting up the basic data in your project** into five tasks:

- [Task 1: Create the assessment scale](#ftoc-heading-2)
- [Task 2: Set up custom leadership roles](#ftoc-heading-3)
- [Task 3: Create check-offs (aka "events")](#ftoc-heading-4)
- [Task 4: Set up an external system](#ftoc-heading-5)
- [Task 5: Add custom fields](#ftoc-heading-6)

When you’ve completed these tasks, your project will be ready to accept its first imported list, which we’ll cover in the next step of this guide.

### Task 1: Create the assessment scale

Most organizing campaigns track where the workers stand in relation to the campaign’s goals using a numeric assessment scale. With Broadstripes, you can choose how many numbers you have on your scale, and also customize the descriptive text for each number. Here’s how:

### Task 2: Set up custom leadership roles

Identifying leaders within the bargaining unit or worker group can be an important part of organizing. For instance, in labor organizing there might be “Committee” and “Key Leader” roles; in community organizing there may be “Activists” and “Mobilizers”. Whatever roles you use, here's how to set them up before you begin your import:

### Task 3: Create check-offs (AKA "events" and "event steps")

Next, we’ll add any check-offs you plan to use to capture completed actions in the operation of your campaign – things like signed cards collected, rallies attended, or any other one-time occurrences you can capture with a checkbox.

In Broadstripes, check-offs like these are one of the most commonly-used custom data types, and they have their own name. In Broadstripes, these check-offs are called “event steps,” and related event steps can be grouped together as “events.”

When setting up your project for the first time, you’ll need to create new events for all the check-off data you plan to import. Here's how you do it:

### Task 4: Create an external system

If it’s likely that you'll import an updated version of your spreadsheet data in the future, and the data contains a unique ID for each record (say, for example, a bargaining unit list from an employer), you'll want to create something called an “external system.”

Creating an external system tells Broadstripes that there’s another data source out there with a unique ID for each person.

**You can skip this step if you expect to import your spreadsheet data only once (i.e. you don’t expect updates) or you’re not planning to import data at all.**

To create an external system, the first thing you need to do is to teach Broadstripes about that outside source. Here’s how you do that:

### Task 5: Add custom fields

Now we’re almost done setting up the basic data in your project.

The last thing you need to do is add your custom fields to the project. By design, Broadstripes already has fields built into each project to collect common data – everything from phone numbers to birthdates – you can see them all in this [built-in fields list](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/data-tools-admin/built-in-data/).

Any data that can’t logically be mapped to one of those built-in fields, and is not one of the [event checkoffs you just created](#ftoc-heading-5), needs to be captured in a custom field.

Custom fields can apply to people, organizations, or both, and they can capture a wide variety of data types (like date, text, numeric, checkbox, radio button, dropdown box, and longer format memo text).

Here’s how to create one:

### Next steps:

Congratulations! You’re done with **Step 1: Setting up the basic data in your project.**

With the basic data in your project set up, Broadstripes is now ready for your first imported list.

Next up, visit the “Step 2: Prepare a spreadsheet for Import” page to learn how to get your list properly formatted and ready so you don’t run into any surprises before you import it.
