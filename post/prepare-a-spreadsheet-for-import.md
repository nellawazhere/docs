They are:

- Create the export spreadsheet
- Format the spreadsheet
- Format the data in the spreadsheet

## Create the export spreadsheet

Most data imports begin with creating a data export file from your existing database system, but you can import any spreadsheet as long as it is in .**csv**, .**xls**, or .**xlsx** format.

If you are importing from multiple systems, that’s fine. Imports are handled one file at a time, and there is no limit to how many files you import into Broadstripes.

## Guidelines for creating export files

- Try to keep the number of rows per export file under 10,000 (if you need to do more than that, just contact us).
- Accepted file types are .**csv**, .**xls**, .**xlsx**
- Importing as much worker-related data as possible in one file will make your life easier, but it is possible to import multiple spreadsheets.

## Format the spreadsheet

Once you've created your export file, you'll want to take some time to format and clean up the spreadsheet prior to importing it.

Using a data tool like Excel to fine-tune your spreadsheet for import is covered in the [Format the spreadsheet article](https://help.broadstripes.com/v2018/docs/format-the-spreadsheet) and includes fixing problems like:

- Missing or poorly labeled header rows
- Typos
- Blanks
- Duplicates

## Format your data

You'll also want to look at your data column by column to be sure it's formatted to maximize Broadstripes' built-in features.

Examples of specific data types are covered in the [Format the data article](https://help.broadstripes.com/v2018/docs/data-type-handling), including:

- Names
- Addresses and geocoding
- Phone numbers and email
- Events
- Custom fields
- Lists
- Employment info
- Leader roles
- Assessments
- User IDs
