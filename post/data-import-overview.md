####   Imports are permanent

When you run a data import, you need to know that the import is permanent, and there is no easy way to roll back your changes.

Data import allows you to bring new worker lists into Broadstripes so you can begin organizing.

Data import also lets you update existing Broadstripes worker data with new data from employer lists or from other union databases (for example, dues and membership systems).

This section knowledge base guides you through the import process, with lots of tips and tricks on how to set up your project and format a spreadsheet — in no time, you'll be importing like a pro. Here are the steps involved:

1. Identify your data source and extract a spreadsheet
2. [Set up your Broadstripes project](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/set-up-a-project/) to receive the data
3. Prepare the spreadsheet for import
4. [Import](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/data-import-admin/import-a-spreadsheet/)
5. Review the results
