This article covers how to maintain external systems data by reimporting.

## Updating through regular imports

Because data from external systems is captured from an external system and loaded into Broadstripes at a certain point in time, you can view external systems data as a “snapshot” of the data at the moment it was exported.

When the data is changed or deleted in its native environment (outside of Broadstripes), those updates will not be captured until the next import into Broadstripes. Performing regular imports ensures that the data you see in Broadstripes is up to date.

### Examples of update schedules for external systems

- Organization A imports voter files each November when the state releases its voter lists
- Organization B imports employee records every month, when HR sends a list of employees who have paid dues
