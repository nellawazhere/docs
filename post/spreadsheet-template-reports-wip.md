OVERVIEW

Spreadsheet template reports are a Broadstripes feature that allows you to make custom counts that you can't make using the app's other report features. You can also use the reports to generate a lot of different counts at once. By uploading your own spreadsheet into Broadstripes, you have complete control over the formulas and information you use for your count.

BUILD YOUR REPORT: Start with a spreadsheet of information you want Broadstripes to count. In the first column, name every count in a way that will make sense to you: for instance, if you are counting all 1-on-ones had, name it something like "1:1s (Cumulative). If you are counting within a specific timeframe, name the column "1:1s this week."

The next column you'll need is a column for your formulas, which you can name something like "Total" or "Count." This is the crucial column that will allow Broadstripes to read your spreadsheet. Here you will use any number of different spreadsheet formulae to generate the custom counts that you want. For the sake of this simple example, we'll use the simple Excel command "?COUNT".

In the Count column, paste in the list that you \[/et\_pb\_text\]\[/et\_pb\_column\]\[/et\_pb\_row\]\[/et\_pb\_section\]
