Hi there!

You've probably arrived at this page because you've been asked to help with a phone banking campaign.

The Broadstripes Call Center is a phone-banking app that makes phone outreach simple and effective.Â  This video will walk you through exactly how to get started including:

- who to call
- how to make your first call
- exactly what to say when you reach someone
- how to save the responses you get in the cloud to be shared with other organizers working on the campaign (spoiler: don't worry, Broadstripes handles this part automatically)
