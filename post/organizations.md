Here's an outline of the built-in data fields for organizations in Broadstripes.

**Name**: The official name of the organization.

**Parent Organization**: If the organization you are creating is, for instance, a department or section within a larger organization, you can link it to its parent organization using this field. Searching with a keyword (e.g. "hospital") will return a list of organizations to choose from. You cannot create a new organization on this page; you must select an organization that has already been entered into Broadstripes, or else leave the field blank for now.

**Nickname**: If the organization is commonly called something other than its official name, input it here. For instance, Saint Vincent Hospital's nickname could be "SVH."

**Notes**: This is a simple text box for preserving information that does not fit neatly into a format, and also should not be its own custom field. Often notes are bits of information specific to the organization, for instance, "Floor 12 supervisor is Mary." **\[not really sure when you would use notes for organizations tbh?\]**

**Website**: If the employer/organization has a website, it can be stored in this field. **Does this still display? I don't think it does.**
