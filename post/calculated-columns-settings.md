Calculated columns allow you to create and display custom metrics for your project. You can learn more about what calculated columns can do in the [Working with Calculated Columns](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/working-with-calculated-columns/) article.

Once your custom columns have been created, you can manage them from **Project settings**.

1. To get started, access **Calculated columns** by clicking **Settings** > **All settings** in the upper right corner of any page.
