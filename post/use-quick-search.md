## Quick search

Much of the work you do in Broadstripes will begin with a search. Whether you're trying to pull up the record of one specific person, or all the people at a certain work location, it's simple with **Quick Search**.

1. Click the **Quick Search** link in the toolbar to begin.  
    ![](images/LeftNavPanel-Quick-Search.png)
2. **Quick search** will open in a new window. Start typing to **Find by name** (to find just one worker) or **Find by Employment/location** (to see all workers at a given location).
3. As you type, Broadstripes will suggest names for you.![](images/6083fd6-QuickSearchPerson.png)
4. If you're searching by **location**, but have tiered employments (for instance, departments, sub-departments, and floors) that's OK. Just type the name of the location you're looking for — Broadstripes will automatically search all levels of the employment hierarchy and suggest a match.\[caption id="attachment\_2131" align="aligncenter" width="553"\]![Employment searches will look at all levels of an employment hierarchy to find the right location.](images/ab136f6-QuickSearchbyEmp.png) Employment searches will look at all levels of an employment hierarchy to find the right location.\[/caption\]

1. Click **Go** to launch the search.
2. By default, your **search results** will appear on screen using your current layout.![](images/1413c91-QuickSearchPersonResults.png)
3. You can **hover over** the worker's name and click the  **looking glass icon** to see more details about them.![QuickSearchZoom](images/7a61fc2-QuickSearchZoom.png)
4. If you'd like to **export** the search results or see your results displayed using **another layout**, click **Options** before launching your search.![QuickSearchOptions](images/9948a56-QuickSearchOptions.png)
5. Use the **Layout drop-down menu** to choose from any of your **saved layouts**. (Learn more about saved layouts in the [Create and save a layout](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/customize/save-a-layout/) article.)![QuickSearchOptionsLayout](images/04882b7-QuickSearchOptionsLayout.png)
6. Instead of simply displaying search results on screen, Broadstripes can also save search results in new files for you to download in **.pdf format** or one of several **spreadsheet formats** (.xls or .csv).![QuickSearchOptionsOutput](images/a283344-QuickSearchOptionsOutput.png)

1. After you've chosen layout and output options, click **Go** to launch the search. Depending on your choices, Broadstripes will show the search results on screen, or export your results to a file you can save.
