## Intro

Congratulations! You’ve reached Step 4: Inviting your organizers and getting them organizing, the last section of the Getting Started Guide**.**

This page will guide you through the final tasks required to get your team organizing with Broadstripes.

As a quick re-cap, you should already have:

1. Customized your project’s data.
2. Prepared a worker data spreadsheet for import (if you have one).
3. Imported the spreadsheet (again, if you have one).

(If you still need to do any of these things, click the appropriate link and check out those pages before continuing on.)

Now it’s time to invite your team members to become users of Broadstripes and set up their homepages to help them get comfortable!

We’ve broken down **Step 4: Inviting your organizers and getting them organizing** into five tasks:

- [Task 1: Invite organizers to your project](#ftoc-heading-2)
- [Task 2: Assign turf](#ftoc-heading-3)
- [Task 3: Build useful layouts](#ftoc-heading-4)
- [Task 4: Save searches](#ftoc-heading-5)
- [Task 5: Set up quick links](#ftoc-heading-6)

When you’ve completed these tasks, your work getting started with Broadstripes will be done, and your organizing team will be up and running!

### Task 1: Invite organizers to your project

Unless your organizing team is unusually large, it's easiest to simply invite organizers one by one.

This video will guide you through this process. You can find more details about inviting and managing users in the [Users and membership guide.](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/running-a-project-admin/user-and-membership-overview/)

#### Want to set up your team for success?

Once you’ve invited your organizers to the project and they’ve accepted the invitations, you can make Broadstripes feel more intuitive for them by customizing the app for them in several ways.

The next four tasks will guide you through how to do that.

### Task 2: Assign turf

**Turf** is how Broadstripes captures the way the organizers see the workplace (AKA turf). Turf structure can capture “shops,” “departments,” and “sub-departments,” or “buildings” and “floors,” or “cities” and “neighborhoods” – or almost any other hierarchical information you have about where people work.

In this video, we'll show you how to assign these workplaces to the organizers who will be leading them.

### Task 3: Build useful layouts

Building **layouts** for your organizers lets you control the look and contents of the most commonly-used Broadstripes page – the search results panel. Your users will see just the columns of data they need, and you can leave out any data that might get in the way. Once you’ve created a layout, it can be applied to any search results at any time.

What’s more, you can create different layouts for different teams or tasks. You can even share layouts, so whole organizing teams can work from the same set of crucial information. By creating good layouts, your users will be able to view and record information in the most effective way possible.

Here's how to create useful layouts your team will thank you for:

### Task 4: Save searches

A simple **search** may look up people or shops based just one criteria, like a name. More complex searches can combine multiple search criteria to drill down to a specific group of people, like those who show union support but haven't signed a card yet, or people from a certain workplace who haven't been contacted lately.

Useful searches like this can be saved and shared with your Broadstripes users, serving as a huge timesaver.

In this video, we'll show you how to create and share useful searches with your organizers.

### Task 5: Set up Quick Links

NOTE: Need to talk about user groups here!

**Quick Links** offer your users a simple dashboard customized to their specific needs—a fast one-click entry point to their most frequent searches or reports.

Configuring quick links is simple, and once it’s done, customized quick links appear automatically, each time a user logs in. Here's how to set up a quick link and assign it to a single organizer or whole group of organizers:

### That's a wrap!

That’s it! Congratulations! You’ve done everything needed to get your Broadstripes project ready for your team. Now it's time to start organizing with Broadstripes!

Keep in mind that your work as an admin will probably continue beyond today. Initially, your users will have lots of questions they’ll need answered.

To help point users in the right direction, you can guide them to our [Getting Started video for users.](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/get-started/getting-started-video/) This will show them around a few of the most important functions of the app – so they can start organizing effectively right away.

You should also expect to field questions for a while as your organizers get started with the project. The [User Guides](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/) section of the knowledge base is a great place for your organizers to go to learn more about using Broadstripes.

As your team becomes more comfortable with Broadstripes, you may decide you want to make further data changes and customizations to allow them to make the most of the app. That's great! We designed the [Admin Guides](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/) section of the knowledge base for just this reason – to serve as a resource for admins like you to learn your way around the tools only admins can access.

And remember, we're here if you need us. Just click the "Help" link on any Broadstripes page to get back to the knowledge base, or the smiling red chat icon on any page in Broadstripes or the knowledge base for one-on-one support.

Happy organizing!
