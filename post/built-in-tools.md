## Overview

Broadstripes was built primarily to help labor organizers find and use information effectively during campaigns. One of its strengths is the built-in tools within Broadstripes that collect and organize information specific to labor organizing:

- Assessment codes
- Leadership roles
- Broadstripes built-in data fields

Here's a quick look at those organizing tools designed to address workers' personal opinions, leadership in social groups, and employment information:

## **Assessment codes** 

### Assessment codes allow you to track and count how workers are feeling about something.

You can code a worker using a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 usually meaning "on board" and 5 meaning "most hostile." Usually, organizers use assessments to count who will sign a union card or vote in a union election. You can also use assessments to count petition signatures, keep track of potential votes in political elections, or to turn out workers to meetings or rallies.

## **Leadership roles**

### Leader roles allow you to map out a shop leadership structure in Broadstripes.

You name leaders in your shop, then assign them people to lead. You can then view your leadership structure in an auto-generated tree diagram. Read more about defining and using [Leadership roles](../leadership-roles/)...

## **Broadstripes' built-in data fields**

### Built-in fields are information fields that are built into the app with union organizers in mind.

You can easily populate your project with workers' addresses, departments, and more in just a few minutes using built-in fields. Learn more about [Broadstripes' built-in data fields...](../built-in-data/)
