# Action: Add to list/Remove from list

* * *

## Add contacts to a tag list

One of the most common bulk actions applied to search results is adding contacts to a tag list. **Tag lists** give you an easy way to manually tag individuals whom you want to track as a group for any reason (for instance your key volunteers, or the people you need to follow up with this month). You can learn more about setting up and using this feature in the [Tag Lists](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/admin-tools/data-tools-admin/tag-lists/) overview article.

Once you know which contacts you want to add to your list, you're ready. This article will explain how to create a new list and add contacts. It will also take you through steps to edit the list and add or remove people later.

## Add people to a tag list

1. From the **Search Results** page, [select the contacts](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/working-with-search-results/selecting-deselecting-contacts/) you want to add to your list. (If you need help running a search, check out the [Use the Quick Search](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/get-started/use-quick-search/), [Search by workplace](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/search/search-by-workplace/), or [Create and save a search](https://help.broadstripes.com/help-articles/using-broadstripes/customize/create-and-save-a-search/) articles.)

1. You can choose to add the contacts to one of your existing personal or shared lists, or add them to a new list. For this example, we'll choose to **add a new list.**

1. **Enter a name for the new list** and indicate whether you want the share the list with others (**Shared**), or have it visible only to you (**Personal**). Click **Add** to create the list and automatically add the contacts you selected in the previous step.

You don't have to start from the **Lists** page to remove a person from a tag list. You can check any person displayed on _any_ search results page, then remove them using the same steps outlined below.

1. From the **Actions** drop-down menu, select **Remove from list**.

####   Do not "Delete" a contact by mistake

Remember that you need to choose **Remove from list** from the **Actions** menu. Choosing **Delete** from this menu by mistake will permanently erase the contact from your _entire project_.
